## What is Terraria Otherworld?
 
Terraria Otherworld was a game that aimed to expand the Terraria universe with a new twist. It was set in an alternate dimension where the world was corrupted by a mysterious force called the Corruption. The player had to restore the world's purity by using new tools, weapons, and towers. The game also featured a more RPG-like progression system, a revamped combat system, and a dynamic weather system.
 
The game was different from Terraria in many aspects, such as having a more linear story, a darker tone, and a higher difficulty level. The game also had a co-op mode where up to four players could team up and explore the world together.
 
## Why was Terraria Otherworld Cancelled?
 
Terraria Otherworld faced many challenges during its development. The game was initially developed by Engine Software, but Re-Logic decided to switch to Pipeworks Studio in 2016 due to unsatisfactory progress. However, even with the new developer, the game still had many issues and bugs that prevented it from reaching its full potential.
 
In 2018, Re-Logic announced that they had cancelled Terraria Otherworld after three years of development. They stated that they felt that the game was too far from their original vision and that they did not want to compromise their quality standards. They also apologized to the fans who were looking forward to the game and thanked them for their support.
